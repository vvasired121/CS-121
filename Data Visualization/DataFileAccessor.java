  /* 
   * This method parses one line from the data file. 
   * The line is tokenized using the String class split method. The split method returns an array of Strings.
   * These Strings are called "tokens".
   * Since the file is comma-delimited (.csv file), the split method uses the comma as a delimiter.
   * Each line (not including a header) is of the form: Month, high temp, low temp.  For example: January,33,13.
   * For example, the first token is "January", the second token is "33", and the third token is "13".
   * The second and third tokens are Strings and have to be converted to integers by the Integer.parseInt method.
   * Then the converted tokens, a String and two int values are passed to a call to the TempData constructor.
   * This new TempData object is then placed on dataList.

   * If the data file has a header- i.e. column names in the first row, seriesOneName is assigned 
   * to the second token (the second column name), and seriesTwoName is assigned to the third token.
   * The firstLine variable is used to detect when processLine is called on the first line. It should
   * be set to false after the first line has been processed. If the data file has no header, firstLine 
   * will be false.

   * This method throws a DataFileProcessingException if:
   * 1) A row in the data does not have three values. If this is the case, the message should be:
   * "Incorrect line length: "+ line (see the test file test3.csv).
   * 2) The second or third values are not numeric. You can detect this by catching a NumberFormatException,
   * which is thrown by the Integer.parseInt method if it trys to parse non-numeric data. If a NumberFormatException 
   * is caught, throw a new DataFileProcessingException.
   * The message for the DataFileProcessingException should be: "Encountered non-numeric data: "+line
   * (see the test file test4.csv).
   * (Of course, you would put the Integer.parseInt calls in a try block).
